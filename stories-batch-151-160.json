    "storyText": "Little Maya was learning about how bodies work. 'How does blood carry oxygen?' she asked her teacher.\n\n'It uses a special protein called hemoglobin!' her teacher said. 'A long time ago, a scientist named Max Perutz figured out the structure of hemoglobin - how it's shaped and how it carries oxygen through our blood!'\n\n'How does it work?' Maya asked.\n\n'Hemoglobin is like a tiny taxi for oxygen,' her teacher explained. 'It picks up oxygen in our lungs and carries it to all parts of our body. Understanding its structure helped us understand how our bodies work!'\n\n'That's amazing!' Maya said.\n\n'It is,' her teacher said. 'Hemoglobin is essential for life. Without it, our bodies couldn't get the oxygen they need. Understanding its structure helps doctors help people with blood problems!'\n\nMaya thought for a moment. 'So hemoglobin helps us breathe?'\n\n'Yes!' her teacher said. 'Hemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to every part of our body. It's like a delivery system that keeps us alive!'\n\nThat night, as Maya lay in bed, she thought about hemoglobin carrying oxygen through her body.\n\n'Our bodies are amazing,' she whispered.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, she dreamed of tiny hemoglobin molecules carrying oxygen through blood, keeping bodies healthy and strong.\n\nWhen Maya woke up, she felt amazed by how our bodies work, knowing that science helps us understand the amazing systems that keep us alive.",
