Understanding black hole structure helps us understand how space and time work!'\n\n'That's amazing!' Alex said.\n\n'It is,' his father said. 'Black holes help us understand gravity and how space and time are connected. Understanding their structure helps us understand the universe!'\n\nAlex looked at the picture. 'So black holes are mysterious?'\n\n'Yes!' his father said. 'Black holes are mysterious objects that help us understand how the universe works. Scientists are still learning about them!'\n\nThat night, as Alex lay in bed, he thought about black holes with their incredibly strong gravity.\n\n'Black holes are amazing,' he whispered.\n\nAnd as he drifted off to sleep, he dreamed of black holes in space, helping scientists understand the universe.\n\nWhen Alex woke up, he felt amazed by black holes, knowing that science helps us understand the mysteries of space.",
