    "storyText": "Little Maya was taking deep breaths. 'What's in the air I'm breathing?' she asked her father.\n\n'Great question!' her father said. 'A long time ago, a scientist named Joseph Priestley discovered something called oxygen - a special gas in the air that we need to breathe!'\n\n'How did he discover it?' Maya asked.\n\n'He did experiments with different gases,' her father explained. 'He found that one gas made candles burn brighter and helped mice breathe better. He called it \"dephlogisticated air\" - we now call it oxygen!'\n\n'That's amazing!' Maya said.\n\n'It is,' her father said. 'Oxygen is essential for life. We breathe it in, and it helps our bodies work. Without it, we couldn't live!'\n\nMaya took another deep breath. 'So oxygen is in every breath I take?'\n\n'Yes!' her father said. 'About one-fifth of the air we breathe is oxygen. Plants make it, and we breathe it. It's a wonderful cycle that keeps all living things alive!'\n\nThat night, as Maya lay in bed, she thought about oxygen and how it helps us breathe.\n\n'Air is amazing,' she whispered.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, she dreamed of oxygen molecules floating in the air, helping all living things breathe and live.\n\nWhen Maya woke up, she felt grateful for the air we breathe, knowing that science helps us understand what keeps us alive.",
